In the notebook attached herewith, there are three methods specifically mentioned.
1. Generating price of an European Option using SDE solutions.
2. Numerically predict price of an European Option using Binomial Tree method.
3. Roped in Monte Carlo method to simulate price of an European Option using both brute force and variance reduction using option delta control
